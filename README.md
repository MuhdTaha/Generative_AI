# Generative AI Specialist Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of projects from the **Generative AI Specialist certification program**. This repository showcases a series of advanced applications that leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **multi-agent systems**, and **hybrid AI techniques** to solve complex, real-world problems.

Each project demonstrates a unique application of Generative AI,  from automated resume screening and intelligent Q&A systems to self-improving summarization agents and hybrid classifiers.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

This portfolio contains **five distinct projects**, each in its own directory.

| Project | Title | Core Technologies | Description |
|----------|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Project 01** | AI-Powered Knowledge Graph | Streamlit, Gemini, Neo4j | An automated pipeline that transforms PDF resumes into an interactive knowledge graph for advanced screening. |
| **Project 02** | GraphRAG-Powered Q&A System | Streamlit, Gemini, GraphRAG | A conversational agent that answers natural language questions by querying the resume knowledge graph. |
| **Project 03** | Reflection-Critic Agents | Streamlit, Gemini, LangGraph | A multi-agent system that generates high-quality PDF summaries through a process of critique and iterative revision. |
| **Project 04** | Conversational Task Agent | Streamlit, Gemini, Python Sandbox | A sophisticated agent that can plan complex tasks, generate Python code, and execute it in a secure environment. |
| **Project 05** | Hybrid Document Classifier | Streamlit, Gemini, Scikit-learn | An intelligent system that combines an LLM and a classical ML model to classify documents with high accuracy and efficiency. |
